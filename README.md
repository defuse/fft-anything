# fft-anything

This is some _really_ bad Rust code for making fourier transform visualizations.
By default it will draw an animation that shows you how two ~20Hz sine wave
pulses of different lengths are generated by summing under 1000 complex
exponentials.

**Dependencies:** You will need SDL2 libraries, including SDL2_ttf installed on your system.

To use it, generate the frames in .png files:

```
mkdir frames
cargo run --relase
```

Then compile the .png frames into an actual video (requires `ffmpg`):

```
./compile-video.sh
```

Modify the code if you want it to do anything different! You can set the
`render` variable to false to skip generating the .png files so it runs faster.
